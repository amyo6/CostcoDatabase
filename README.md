# Costco Database Project - INFO 330

Project Overview
Our team was assigned the Costco case study. The objective was to develop a database tailored to Costco’s business needs by focusing on the key users who interact with Costco and would benefit from this database.

We identified these as our database's key users: 
- Businesses that shop at Costco
- Members of Costco
- Consumers who own Costco gift cards

Key Deliverables
Business Context Description: We analyzed Costco’s industry, company type, and business processes to define who would use the database and what decisions the database would help inform.

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Following best practices from lectures and readings, we created conceptual and logical ER diagrams representing Costco’s data structures and relationships. The ERD was saved as a PDF and served as the blueprint for our database design.

Physical Database Model: We translated the ERD into a physical database schema using SQL, creating tables, relationships, and constraints appropriate for Costco’s operations.

Database Population: We populated the database with sample data to simulate realistic business scenarios for testing and validation.

Purpose of the Database
The database was designed to support Costco’s diverse users — businesses, members, and gift card consumers — by providing reliable data on products, inventory, sales, and customer interactions. This enables more informed decision-making related to inventory management, sales trends, and customer service improvements.
